Higher attrition in certain job roles or departments may signal issues with management or career development opportunities. Gender or marital status differences in turnover could point to work-life balance challenges. Age-based trends suggest the need for tailored retention strategies, such as career growth programs for younger employees. Understanding these factors enables organizations to implement targeted actions to reduce attrition and improve employee satisfaction.
